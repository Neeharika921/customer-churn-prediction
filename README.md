# Customer Churn Prediction System



## Project Overview



This project predicts whether a customer is likely to churn (leave the service) or stay, using Machine Learning. It includes complete data analysis, model training, and deployment as a web application using Streamlit.



Customer churn prediction helps companies improve customer retention and reduce revenue loss.
